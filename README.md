## Difficult words

Difficult words is a Wep Progressive Application which allows you to find the "hardest" words in a film or TV Show by using the subtitle.
Actually, it can parse every text provided as .txt file.

It uses [OpenSubtitles API](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/subs) to fetch the subtitle of the film/episode.
Then, it uses [DataMuse](https://datamuse.com/) to retieve definition and frequency.
